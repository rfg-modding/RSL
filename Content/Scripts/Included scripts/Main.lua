--[[ Note that since this script is called main.lua (case doesn't matter), 
 it's run on script loader startup, right after the 3 activation beeps.
 Once event driven functions are in this will be the way to go for having
 a mod that runs when the game starts, where you'll setup all your event hooks
 For now this is mainly useful for setting up console commands, like what this 
 example does. By having a function defined here the function becomes available 
 for use by the lua state at RSL startup, meaning you can use it in the console
 as it's simply a lua interpreter.]]
