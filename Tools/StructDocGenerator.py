# Takes a file path as input. Attempts to read a c-style struct/class from it and generate
# a restructured text sphinx docs page for that class. Has some limitations currently:
# - Can't handle functions, comments, or specifiers like const, volatile, static, etc
# - Can't handle multiple public/private/protected values. Only one right at the start of the class
# - Can't handle additional specifiers in the class declaration like declspec(align(some_number)) or whatever thing
# - Can't handle multiple inherited classes
# - Can only handle one class/struct definition per input file
# - Doesn't properly name array types. Keeps array size on variable name.
#
# Some of these limitations will be fixed in the future and some of them don't really matter for the pusposes of the RSL.
# Since most classes being bound and documented are the games classes dumped with IDA as c-style classes with no functions or constructors
# some of these limitations are minor issues. Usually only slight modifications of a class definition must be made to get a correct parse.
